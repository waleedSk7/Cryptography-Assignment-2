## Registration Flow

### Merchant Registration

1. Merchant provides:

   - Initial balance
   - IFSC Code
2. Bank generates:
   - 16-digit Merchant ID (MID)
   - MID = Hash(name + timestamp + password) using SHA256
3. Account creation in blockchain
4. Credentials provided to merchant

### User Registration

1. User provides:
   - Username
   - Password
   - Mobile number
   - UPI PIN
   - Initial balance
2. Bank generates:
   - 16-digit User ID (UID)
   - Mobile Money Identifier (MMID)
3. Account creation in blockchain
4. Credentials provided to user

## Payment Flow

### QR Code Generation

1. Merchant logs into system
2. Enters Merchant ID (MID)
3. UPI Machine:
   - Encrypts MID using SPECK algorithm
   - Generates Virtual Merchant ID (VMID)
   - Creates QR code containing VMID
4. QR code displayed to merchant

### Payment Process

1. User scans merchant's QR code
2. User provides:
   - MMID
   - Transaction amount
   - UPI PIN
3. Data processing:
   - Data hashed for security
   - Sent to UPI Machine
4. UPI Machine:
   - Decrypts merchant VMID
   - Forwards to bank
5. Bank processing:
   - Validates user credentials
   - Checks balance
   - Verifies PIN
   - Creates blockchain entry
6. Transaction completion:
   - Success/Failure notification
   - Balance updates
   - Transaction recorded in blockchain

## Quantum Security Analysis

### Shor's Algorithm Implementation

1. **Initialization**
   - Setup quantum simulation environment using Qiskit simulator
   - Define small test parameters (N=15, a=7) for demonstration
   - Explain how this scales to RSA parameters (modulus N, public exponent e)
   - Prepare educational outputs to explain each step of the process

2. **Quantum Circuit Construction**
   - Create counting register (8 qubits) and target register (4 qubits)
   - Initialize target register to |1⟩ state
   - Apply Hadamard gates to create superposition in counting register
   - Implement controlled modular exponentiation operations
